## Getting Started

To use the functions in this project, you can simply load the R project in RStudio and explore the R code files in the `R` directory. The main functions for distance calculations can be found in `distance_functions.R`, and utility functions are available in `utils.R`.

## Documentation

The documentation for the custom distance functions can be found in the `man` directory, where each function has its own `.Rd` file. You can access the documentation from within R by using the `?function_name` command, where `function_name` is the name of the specific function you want to learn more about.

## Examples

For practical examples and usage explanations, refer to the R Markdown files in the `RMarkDown` directory. These files provide detailed examples of how to use the distance functions on different datasets.
