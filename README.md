# Data Mining with R

This repository contains R code and functions for data mining and distance calculation.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **data**: This directory contains the datasets used in the data mining functions and examples.

- **man**: This directory contains the R documentation (Rd) files for the custom distance functions implemented in this project.

- **R**: This directory contains the main R code files.
    - `distance_functions.R`: This file contains custom R functions for calculating different distance metrics such as Canberra distance, Chebyshev distance, Cosine distance, Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, and Manhattan distance.
    - `utils.R`: This file contains utility functions used by the main R code files.

- **RMarkDown**: This directory contains R Markdown files with examples and explanations of the data mining techniques and distance calculations used in this project.

- **DESCRIPTION**: This file contains metadata and package dependencies information for the R package.

- **DataMiningWithR.Rproj**: This is the RStudio project file.

- **NAMESPACE**: This file specifies which functions and objects in the package should be made available to the users.

## Getting Started

To use the functions in this project, you can simply load the R project in RStudio and explore the R code files in the `R` directory. The main functions for distance calculations can be found in `distance_functions.R`, and utility functions are available in `utils.R`.

## Documentation

The documentation for the custom distance functions can be found in the `man` directory, where each function has its own `.Rd` file. You can access the documentation from within R by using the `?function_name` command, where `function_name` is the name of the specific function you want to learn more about.

## Examples

For practical examples and usage explanations, refer to the R Markdown files in the `RMarkDown` directory. These files provide detailed examples of how to use the distance functions on different datasets.
