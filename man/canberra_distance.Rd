\title{Canberra Distance between Two Vectors}
\usage{
canberra_distance(point1, point2)
}
\arguments{
\item{point1}{A numeric vector representing the first vector.}

\item{point2}{A numeric vector representing the second vector.}
}
\value{
The Canberra distance (a scalar value).
}
\description{
Calculate the Canberra distance between two vectors.
}
\details{
The Canberra distance distance between two points
calculated as:
\deqn{S(x,y) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \frac{|x_i - y_i|}{|x_i| + |y_i|} }
}
\examples{
point1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
point2 <- c(4, 5, 6)
canberra_distance(point1, point2)
}
