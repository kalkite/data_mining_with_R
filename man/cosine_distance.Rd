\title{Cosine Distance between Two Vectors}
\usage{
cosine_distance(point1, point2)
}
\arguments{
\item{point1}{A numeric vector representing the first vector.}

\item{point2}{A numeric vector representing the second vector.}
}
\value{
The cosine distance (a scalar value).
}
\description{
Calculate the cosine distance between two vectors.
}
\details{
The Cosine similarity is the measure of the angle between two vectors
\deqn{S(x,y) =  \frac{x \cdot y}{\|x\| \|y\| }}

Cosine distance calculated as
\deqn{S(x,y) =  1 - S_c(x,y) }
}
\examples{
point1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
point2 <- c(4, 5, 6)
cosine_distance(point1, point2)
}
